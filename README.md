# Mr Strimmer

A Discord stream bot.

## Discord stream bot?

Yes. When you start the bot, it spawns a bunch of what I like to call "widgets". Those widgets can be controlled via bot commands.

In other words, it's a bot designed to make livestreams on discord.

## Quick Start

This project depends on `OpenCV` and `SDL2`, which can be installed via the command:

#### Arch Linux
```console
# pacman -S vtk fmt glew opencv qt5-base clang sdl2
```
